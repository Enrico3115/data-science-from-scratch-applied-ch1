# Data Science from Scratch (Applied)

This repository contains my solutions and applications of Chapter 1 concepts from Joel Grus's *"Data Science from Scratch"*. 

I took the core logic (graph analysis, frequency counting, bucketing) and applied it to real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. The Witcher Network Analysis (`witcher_network.ipynb`)
- **Concept:** Graph Theory & Social Network Analysis.
- **Application:** Analyzed character interactions in *The Witcher* books to find key influencers and "friends of friends."

### 2. IBM HR Analytics (`IBM_analytics_employee.ipynb`)
- **Concept:** Salary & Tenure analysis.
- **Application:** Analyzed IBM attrition data to correlate tenure with salary buckets.

### 3. Netflix Genres (`netflix_genres.ipynb`)
- **Concept:** Data Frequency & Distribution.
- **Application:** Parsed the Netflix catalog to find the most common genre distributions.

### 4. Original Case Study (`friends.ipynb`)
- The original example from the book for reference.
